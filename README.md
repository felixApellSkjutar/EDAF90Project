## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This project uses TS, since JS sucks ass.

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for CSS, [flowbite-svelte](https://flowbite-svelte.com/) is our chosen component library.

## Adding dependencies

Since the project uses yarn instead of npm, new dependencies are added using `yarn add <package-name>`

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
